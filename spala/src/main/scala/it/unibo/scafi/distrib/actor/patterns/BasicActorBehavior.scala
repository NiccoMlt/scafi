/**
 * @author Roberto Casadei
 * Represents a structure for a basic actor, factoring out commonly desired features, such as:
 *   - A behavior compositionally organized according to some semantics
 *   - A {{logger}} for logging
 * The semantics of messages is the following:
 *   - Input/information messages: provide some input, sender expects NO reply
 *   - Query messages: are the requests in a request-response pattern
 *   - Command messages: are requests for performing some operation (possibly to
 *       the internal state); the sender expects a reply/confirmation
